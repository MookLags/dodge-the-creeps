# Dodge the Creeps!
## Purpose
Dodge the Creeps is a part of the Godot documentation; in learning the engine through the official docs, you end up building games a long the way. I built this to:

- Learn Godot
- Prepare myself for future game development (Lots of fun ideas in the works!)
- Have some fun

## Lessons
I learned a lot from this simple little game. Namely:

- How to structure a game
- How Godot works
- Lots of math and physics
  - Vectors
  - Radiants
  - Calculating direction and velocity

## Bummer!
I do all of my development in Vim right in the terminal, so I was a little bummed at how difficult it would be to make this work with some Godot/Vim hybrid work flow. Vim bindigs aren't available in the version of Godot I'm using to build (3.6). 

## Advice
It's always a challenge to get used to new tech and frameworks. I've done a lot of web development; if you have too, it makes it easier to conceptualize Scenes as Components like in front-end frameworks: reusable bits of code that you use as building blocks to make what it is you're making.
